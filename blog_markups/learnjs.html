<p>For the past few months, I've taken on the endeavour of learning the JavaScript (or JS) language. I became interested in learning JS because I wanted to learn how to build my own websites. I built my <a href="http://subredditemailsummary.com/">subreddit email summaries website</a> using Flask and Python. I was satisifed with using Python as the backend language, but I was drawn to JS because of its reputation for being THE language for web development.</p><br>
<p>Anyone who tries to learn new languages/technologies on their own will know that there are multiple ways to obtain these new skills. Here's some of the main ways I've gained technical knowledge:</p><br>
<ul>
    <li>University courses</li>
    <li>LinkedIn Learning videos</li>
    <li>YouTube videos/tutorials</li>
    <li>Technical documentation</li>
</ul><br>
<p>All of these methods have their benefits and drawbacks. I've really enjoyed learning programming in my university courses, but I realize that this method of learning is inaccessible to many. I also really like the high quality tutorials of LinkedIn Learning, and I am lucky enough to be able to view these videos for free (because of my status as a student). This method of learning can also be inaccessible because LinkedIn Learning is usually a paid service.</p><br>

<p>The wonderful part of YouTube videos and tutorials is that they're usually free to view. There's a lot of great people who provide free resources for people to learn from. I've especially enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim">Tech with Tim's</a> high quality Python tutorials. </p><br>

<p>I was interested in finding other high quality online learning materials for JS. I first looked at LinkedIn Learning video tutorials, but I found that the courses covered the fundamentals of programming more in depth than I would have liked. Another pitfall of video tutorials is that there may be less interactive programming exercises associated with the video. It's important for a student to actually practice the topics being taught to them. I occasionally felt myself becoming a passive viewer when watching technical tutorials on LinkedIn Learning or YouTube.</p><br>

<p>I wanted to find a learning resource that would be engaging and let me practice the skills I'm learning. That's when I discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freeCodeCamp.org.</a> freeCodeCamp is a website that has thousands of tutorials about coding and programming concepts. The information is organized into a few big modules (such as Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Scientific Computing with Python) that break down into smaller units. I went through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures module to get my first taste of JS.</p><br>

<p>The JS module had several units, and within each unit is a series of mini-lessons. The thing I really liked about FCC is that each mini-lesson had a challenge associated with it. This challenge was based on the content covered in the mini-lesson, as well as content covered in previous mini-lessons. The student has to complete this challenge in the built-in FCC text editor before moving on to the next lesson. I really liked this because I was able to immediately apply what I was learning. Another great part of FCC is that they have project ideas at the end of a module. This allows students to apply these learned concepts to an actual project that could potentially be put on a resume.</p><br>

<p>After learning the fundamentals of JS through FCC, I wanted to take my learning further by learning front-end web development with React. I was interested in React because it's a very modern and popular framework, and I wanted to build a personal website with it. Since I had a great experience with learning JS through text-based website materials, I wanted to find something similar to learn React. After searching through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">learnprogramming subreddit,</a> I found a resource that piqued my interest.</p><br>

<p><a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">Full Stack Open</a> is a website created by faculty of the University of Helsinki in Finland. It's a completely free online course that is equivalent to a full stack development course in Helsinki's computer science department. The course has 11 units that relate to full stack concepts such as React, Node.js, Express, client-side and server-side programming,and automated testing. Each unit has a few sections which include text-based lessons. At the end of each lesson, there's a series of exercises that the student can complete to apply their knowledge.</p><br>

<p>I adore this resource. First of all, the course makes very little assumptions about prior knowledge with JS. The course assumes you have some programming experience and a little bit of knowledge about HTML and CSS. However, they don't assume you know JS and link to many resources that can help with learning JS along the way. I was fond of the web-based format for this course because the creators include many hyperlinks to resources that supplement the course material. For example, the course provided a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84">Fun Fun Function's YouTube series on functional programming</a> when the course topic was functional components in React. I thought watching this YouTube series greatly supplemented my learning experience and helped me throughout the rest of the course. The course also provides many links to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla's Develepor Reference for JavaScript</a>. It was helpful to read up on some of the more specific JavaScript quirks (many of which weren't covered in the FCC course because of their specificity).</p><br>

<p>Text-based website courses provide many benefits for students learning new technical skills.</p><br>

<h2>Interactive activities/exercises</h2>
<p>Text-based website courses allow more room for interactive exercises to supplement a student's learning. Video tutorials are limited in this way. It can be difficult to incorporate interactivity in a medium that is meant to be only watched. Consider YouTube. There is virtually no way to incorporate exercises directly into a YouTube video. The only way is to link to a resource in the video description. Text-based websites are more flexible because interactive exercises can be interwoven with the course material.</p><br>

<h2>Embedded Links</h2>
<p>Learning through text-based website courses has the benefit of embedded links that supplement learning and provide new avenues for learning. This is something that is not easily replicated in a classroom setting or in the video medium.</p><br>

<h2>Going At Your Own Pace</h2>
<p>Another thing I enjoy about text-based website courses is that learners can go at their own pace through the course material. This usually cannot happen in a traditional classroom setting. Video tutorials also use their own pace that may not be compatible with the student. Some students may not like this aspect of text-based website courses if they need a specific time structures/routine to succeed in a course.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>The resources I've mentioned previously are very accessible because they're free to view for anyone on the internet. While many students may not have the resources to attend university classes to learn programming, the internet is accessible to most (whether through personal computers or computers provided to the public at a library). I like that these resources are accessible to anyone willing to take the time to learn and practice.</p><br>

<p>Overall, I've thoroughly enjoyed learning new technical concepts such as JS through text-based web curriculum. I encourgage people to try finding text-based web curriculum for concepts they'd like to learn, and see if it's a good fir for their learning style. I will be looking for more text-based web curriculum for my future technical learning endeavours.</p>
