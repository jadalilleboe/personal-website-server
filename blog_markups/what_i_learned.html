<p>I wanted to share a little bit about what I learned during the fall semester of 20akldjkf21.</p> 

<p>I took four classes during the fall semester:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical and Professional Writing</li>
  <li>Rhetoric, Technology, and the Internet</li>
  <li>Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
  <li>Discrete Structures of Computer Science</li>
</ul>

<p>I took two classes for my major (computer science) and two classes for my minor (technical writing and communication). I'd like to share some highlights of what I learned in each class.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
<p>I would say this was the class I learned the most in. The class provides an overview on some of the basic concepts in algorithms and data structures such as linked lists, stacks/queues, binary trees and binary search trees, merge sort, binary search, etc. I definitely learned a lot about some of the fundamental concepts of CS. Some of the projects included building a linked list from scratch and creating maze solving algorithms.</p>

<p>I also was introduced to the Java language in this course. I had only had experience with dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript before this, so it was fun to work with a statically typed language. I also learned a lot more about object oriented programming. Learning Java was really fun! Next, I'm gonna be learning C. It'll be interesting to see how C differs from Java.</p>

<h2>Discrete Structures of Computer Science</h2>

<p>In this class, some of the more theoretical concepts of CS were covered. It was more of a math class than a CS class, there wasn't any programming involved. I learned a lot of things in this class. Some of the topics were set theory, proofs (especially induction proofs), functions/relations, and counting problems/probability. I enjoyed this class because it made me see CS in a different way, and it also helped me see different ways of solving problems. This was definitely a difficult class, but a rewarding one as well. </p>

<h2>Technical and Professional Writing</h2>

<p>I learned to write professional and technical documents in this class. The class centered around 3 writing assignments: a technical definition, a memo detailing two interviews, and a ten page proposal. For my technical definition, I made a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jadalilleboe/personal-website-server/main/.github/images/api_def.pdf">document defining the term API</a>. That was a fun one! I honed my writing skills in this class and practiced writing meaningful technical documents.</p>

<h2>Rhetoric, Technology, and The Internet</h2>

<p>This was more of a discussion based class. We discussed a lot of topics in rhetoric and technology, such as racially biased algorithms and concerns of privacy and surveillance on the internet. It was enlightening to learn more about current problems in technology today.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm happy that I got to learn a lot of new things and I'm excited to see what's next! Next semester I'll be taking courses in linear algebra, machine architechture and organization, and algorithms and data structures.</p>
