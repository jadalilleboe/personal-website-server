<!-- title: How I built an API for My Blog's Website -->
<p>Creating this personal website has been my main project over these past few weeks. I began by working on the visual and frontend aspects of my website. </p>

<p> I used HTML, CSS, React, and React Bootstrap to create these frontend elements. These tools were great for creating the purely visual aspects of my website, however, I discovered their limits when I decided I wanted to add a blog to my website.</p>

<p>I realized that if I wanted to create a set of blog posts with React, I would have to hard code every single blog post into the React application. I wanted to dynamically render my blog posts and store them outside of the React application.So, I decided to create a backend server and API that my React frontend could communicate with.</p>

<h2>Purpose of Server and API</h2>

<p>I made a server so my frontend would be able to make requests elsewhere to get the data it needed. In this case, my frontend would make a request to the backend to get data about all of the blog posts that need rendering. Then, my React frontend can render all of these posts without having their content hard-coded into the application. Yay!</p>

<p>My server also functions as an API. I created endpoints that can accept GET and POST requests. If I want to create a new blog post, I make a POST request to the API. If I want to get all of the data about the blog posts, I make a GET request to the API (this is what my React frontend does).</p>

<p>However, the data about my blog posts is not actually stored in the backend server. For storing the blog posts, I created a database to hold information such as the title of the blog post, content of the blog post, and they day it was created. Because data is not stored in the server, my server has to connect to the database and get the data from there. This flow of data from the frontend to the backend to the database is called the Controller-Model-View Schema.</p>

<p>In this schema, the "View" (AKA frontend) and the "Model" (AKA database) never directly communicate with each other. Data only can flow from the database to the frontend by going through the "Controller" (AKA server). The server controls the communication between the frontend and the database.</p>

<h2>Tools I Used to Create My Server and API</h2>

<p>Now, I'll share the specific tools I used to create my blog server and API.</p>

<h3>Node.js</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> to create the server for my website. Node.js is a backend framework for the JavaScript language. Since I was already using JavaScript with React on the frontend, it seemed like a natural choice for the backend. My frontend can send requests to my Node.js server and get responses back.</p>

<h3>Express.js</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express.js</a> to create the endpoints of my API and do all of the routing for the server. Express dictates how different requests such as GET and POST are handled by the server.</p>

<h3>MongoDB Atlas</h3>

<p>I used MongoDB and their cloud service <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas" target="_blank">MongoDB Atlas</a> as my database. The nice thing about MongoDB Atlas is that you can host your database for free! There's also a really great node package called Mongoose that I used to connect my backend and database.</p>

<h3>Heroku</h3>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> to host my server. I needed to host my server somewhere because my website needs to call upon it whenever someone visits the blog webpage. Something I didn't like about Heroku is that an app will idle if you're using the free tier. This means it would take a good amount of time to load the data whenever my blog page would be loaded. I had to upgrade to the "Hobby" tier to stop my server from idling, and it costs $7/month...</p>
