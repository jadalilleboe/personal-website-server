<p><a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> is a developer tool/platform for testing and creating API's. It's very useful when building a new API or testing an existing one. Postman also has a very vibrant <a href="https://www.postman.com/company/student-program/" target="_blank">student community</a>, which I became involved with a few months ago. I'd like to chronicle my experience with the Postman student community and tell you how you can get involved.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to Postman when an API's 101 workshop hosted by Postman was held at my university. In this workshop, I learned the basics of sending requests to an API and getting a response back. I also learned how the Postman interface works and how to send a request with Postman. It was a fun experience learning about the basics of API's.</p>

<p>After that initial workshop, I was really interested in learning more about how API's work and how I could create my own API. I used resources such as <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en" target="_blank">fullstackopen.com</a> and <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCam[</a> to learn how to build and API. I ended up <a href="https://www.postman.com/jlillebo/workspace/survivor-api/overview" target="_blank">making an API</a> with data from my favorite show, Survivor. I used Postman to test this API and also organize all of the requests that could be made to my API.</p>

<p>After doing a little more work with Postman, I discovered that they had two programs for students: Postman Student Expert and Postman Student Leader. The Postman Student Expert is a training that helps you learn more about how Postman is best utilized. I learned how to set collection and environment variables, use custom scripting, and how to use Postman Visualizer to visualize JSON data from API's. After completing the training, I got a cute little badge that I could put on my LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Soon after receiving my Postman Student Expert badge, I applied to be a Postman Student Leader. Postman Student Leader's advocate for API literacy on their campus by holding API workshops, attending conferences, etc.I was accepted to the program, yay! I got another cute badge for being a Postman Student Leader:</p>

<p>Besides awarding badges, the Postman student community also hosts awesome events for students. On August 7th & 8th, 2021, the virtual <a href="https://www.postman.com/company/student-program/student-summit/" target="_blank">Postman Student Summit</a> was held for students and educators to "collaboratively learn, share, and create all things API". Because I was a Postman Student Leader, I got the chance to present at the conference!</p>

<p>I presented the talk "How I Created an API for My Website" where I described why I made an API for my website's blog, and the tools I used to do so. Check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L9yeMHb6Csjxc_AxEBrFmOuuleIxMLXyUN0mNKjY6bs/edit#slide=id.ge7b5afba5e_1_0" target="_blank">the slides</a> from the presentation. This was such a fun experience, and I'm really grateful to the Postman student community for allowing me this opportunity!</p>
